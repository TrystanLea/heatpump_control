# Heat pump controller development

Scripts for control of a 5kW EcoDan with FTC2 control unit.

These run on a RaspberryPi connected to a board with a number of solid state relays controlling the volt-free inputs on the FTC2 unit and a DAC converter to set the flow temperature.

This work is early development and I would not recommend using these scripts yet :)
